<p>Homozygosity Mapping is a powerful technique used to narrow the search space for disease-causing variants in exome sequencing data. This has traditionally been performed using a separate micro-array based experiment, but with costs of exomes continuing to fall, homozygosity mapping can be performed using only exome sequence.</p>

<p>This homozygosity mapping tool can retain the region containing the disease-causing variant in a consanguineous pedigree, while eliminating XXX% of identified variants from consideration.</p>
